        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Balochistan occupies the very southeasternmost portion of
the Iranian plateau the setting for the earliest known
farming settlements in the pre-Indus Valley  civilisation 
era, the earliest of which was Mehrgarh, dated around
7000 BCE, 11] within the province.  Balochistan marke  
the westernmost extent of civilisation. Centuries before 
the arrival of Islam in the seventh century, parts of 
Balochistan were ruled by the Paratarajas, an Indo-Scythian
dynasty. At certain times, the Kushan Empire also held 
political sway in parts of Balochistan.[citation needed]
The Hindu Sewa Dynasty ruled parts of Balochistan, chiefly 
Kalat.[12][13] The Sibi Division, which was carved out of Quetta 
Division and Kalat Division in 1974, derives its name from Rani
 Sewi, the queen of the Sewa dynasty.[14]
The region came under rule during the reign of King Kay 
Khosrow of the Kayanian dynasty of Iran. The Baloch, under
 the command of Ashkash,[15] conquered this land, which Makran 
 was a part of Balochistan.[16]
The remnants of the earliest people in Balochistan were the Brahui 
people, a Dravidian-speaking people. The Brahuis retained the
 Dravidian language throughout many millennia.[17]
Although during the Stone and Bronze Age and Alexander
the Great's empire an indigenous population existed, the
Baloch people themselves did not enter the region until 
the 14th century CE.[18] A theory of the origin of the Baloch
people, the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they
are of Median descent.[19] Balochistan[4] (/bəˈloʊtʃɪstɑːn,
 bəˌloʊtʃɪˈstɑːn, -stæn/ bə-LOHTCH-ist-a(h)n, -⁠A(H)N; Balochi: 
 بلۏچستان, romanized: Balòcestàn, [baˈloːt͡ʃest̪ɑːn]), also spelled 
 as Baluchistan or Baluchestan, is a historical region in West and 
 South Asia, located in the Iranian plateau's far southeast and 
 bordering the Indian Plate and the Arabian Sea coastline. This 
 arid region of desert and mountains is primarily populated by 
 ethnic Baloch people.[5][6][7] Balochistan is very significant 
 because of its strategic location, mineral wealth, long coastline 
 along the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Oman and potential for discoveries
  of oil and gas.[8]The Balochistan region is split among three countries:
  Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Administratively it comprises the Pakistani
province of Balochistan; the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan,
along with southern Kerman province,[9] southern South Khorasan province
and eastern Hormozgan province;[10][11] and the southern areas of Afghanistan,
which include Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces.[12][13] It borders what
was historically the Pashtunistan region to the north, Sindh and Punjab to the
east, and southeastern Iran to the west. Its southern coastline, including the
Makran Coast, is washed by the Arabian Sea, in particular by its western part,
 the Gulf of Oman.EtymologyThe proportion of people with Balochi as their mother

The name "Balochistan" is generally believed to derive from the name of the Baloch
 people.[12] Since the Baloch people are not mentioned in pre-Islamic sources, it 
 is likely that the Baloch were known by some other name in their place of origin
  and that they acquired the name "Baloch" only after arriving in Balochistan sometime
   in the 10th century.[14]
John Hansman relates the term "Baloch" to Meluḫḫa, the name by which the Indus Valley
 civilisation is believed to have been known to the Sumerians (2900–2350 BCE) and 
 Akkadians (2334–2154 BCE) in Mesopotamia.[15] Meluḫḫa disappears from the Mesopotamian
  records at the beginning of the second millennium BCE.[16] However, Hansman states that
   a trace of it in a modified form, as Baluḫḫu, was retained in the names of products 
   imported by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BCE).[17] Al-Muqaddasī, who visited the 
   capital of Makran, Bannajbur, wrote c. 985 CE that it was populated by people called 
   Balūṣī (Baluchi), leading Hansman to postulate "Baluch" as a modification of Meluḫḫa 
   and Baluḫḫu.[18]Asko Parpola relates the name Meluḫḫa to Indo-Aryan words mleccha 
   (Sanskrit) and milakkha/milakkhu (Pali) etc., which do not have an Indo-European etymology 
   even though they were used to refer to non-Aryan people. Taking them to be proto-Dravidian 
   in origin, he interprets the term as meaning either a proper name milu-akam (from which 
   tamilakam was derived when the Indus people migrated south) or melu-akam, meaning "high 
   country", a possible reference to Balochistani high lands.[19] Historian Romila Thapar also 
   interprets Meluḫḫa as a proto-Dravidian term, possibly mēlukku, and suggests the meaning 
   "western extremity" (of the Dravidian-speaking regions in the Indian subcontinent). A literal 
   translation into Sanskrit, aparānta, was later used to describe the region by the Indo-Aryans.[20]
During the time of Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE), the Greeks called the land Gedrosia and its
people Gedrosoi, terms of unknown origin.[21] Using etymological reasoning, H. W. Bailey reconstructs 
a possible Iranian name, uadravati, meaning "the land of underground channels", which could have been 
transformed to badlaut in the 9th century and further to balōč in later times. This reasoning remains 
speculative</blockquote></p>
