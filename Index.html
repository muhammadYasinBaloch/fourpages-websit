      <img src="./balochistan.webp" alt=" Blaochistan"  align="right">  Balochistan occupies the very southeasternmost portion of
the Iranian plateau the setting for the earliest known
farming settlements in the pre-Indus Valley  civilisation 
era, the earliest of which was Mehrgarh, dated around
7000 BCE, 11] within the province.  Balochistan marke  
the westernmost extent of civilisation. Centuries before 
the arrival of Islam in the seventh century, parts of 
Balochistan were ruled by the Paratarajas, an Indo-Scythian
dynasty.  At certain times, the Kushan Empire also held 
political sway in parts of Balochistan.[citation needed]
The Hindu Sewa Dynasty ruled parts of Balochistan, chiefly 
Kalat.[12][13] The Sibi Division, which was carved out of Quetta 
Division and Kalat Division in 1974, derives its name from Rani
 Sewi, the queen of the Sewa dynasty.[14]
The region came under rule during the reign of King Kay 
Khosrow of the Kayanian dynasty of Iran. The Baloch, under
 the command of Ashkash,[15] conquered this land, which Makran 
 was a part of Balochistan.[16]
The remnants of the earliest people in Balochistan were the Brahui 
people, a Dravidian-speaking people. The Brahuis retained the
 Dravidian language throughout many millennia.[17]
Although during the Stone and Bronze Age and Alexander
the Great's empire an indigenous population existed, the
Baloch people themselves did not enter the region until 
the 14th century CE.[18] A theory of the origin of the Baloch
people, the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they
are of Median descent.[19] Balochistan[4] (/bəˈloʊtʃɪstɑːn,
 bəˌloʊtʃɪˈstɑːn, -stæn/ bə-LOHTCH-ist-a(h)n, -⁠A(H)N; Balochi: 
 بلۏچستان, romanized: Balòcestàn, [baˈloːt͡ʃest̪ɑːn]), also spelled 
 as Baluchistan or Baluchestan, is a historical region in West and 
 South Asia, located in the Iranian plateau's far southeast and 
 bordering the Indian Plate and the Arabian Sea coastline. This 
 arid region of desert and mountains is primarily populated by 
 ethnic Baloch people.[5][6][7] Balochistan is very significant 
 because of its strategic location, mineral wealth, long coastline

<img src="./cultur 2.webp" alt="" align="right">The culture of Balochistan (Urdu: بلوچ ثقافت, Balochi: بلۏچی دۏد),
or simply Baloch culture, is defined in terms of religious values,
Balochi and Brahui language, literature and traditional values of
mutual respect. It has its roots in the Balochi, Brahui, Sindhi,[1]
and Pashto.[2] Folk music, Balochi handicrafts, drama and Balochi 
cinema play a significant role in Baloch culture.[3][4][5] Quetta, 
the provincial capital of Balochistan, has several historical
 monuments such as Pirak, the Chaukhandi tombs and the Quaid-e-Azam
Residency.[6]On 2 March,[7] Balochistan celebrates its culture day
 every year, where people from different villages gather together 
 to organise various cultural programs. It marks its historical 
significance across the provincial state.[8] The events include 
 folk music, dance, craft exhibition and other activities.[9]
BeliefsLike other people around the world, Balochistan people 
are known for believing in supernatural powers such as the wind
 and sea. They believe that crossing the boundaries of supernatural
  powers like "nazzar" (the evil eye) and jinn can affect or curse a
   human life.[10BackgroundOne of the most important parts of thec
   ultural identity of the Baloch people is the Pashtu and brahui 
   and balochi languages, the "99th most spoken language in the 
   world". This language is spoken only by native people as it is 
   one of the toughest languages. Besides language, Baloch dressing
    has been greatly influenced by the entire country. Their nomadic 
    life style is completely different than other provincial states 
    of the country.[11]Despite celebrating several colourful festivals 
    peacefully and traditionally,[12] there is also an unlawful tradition
     or settlement practice called Baad. Baad (dispute resolution) is an "
     unlawful marriage custom" found in its Harnai district that is used to
      make settlements between two enemies. To be more specific, a girl is 
      given in compensation to a victim whose brother or any family member
       has been killed/murdered by the girl's very close relatives such as
        brother or father. All the decisions related to this custom are made
         by a single individual called jirga, who heads the tribal court. The

<p>  <img src="./map.jpg" alt=" Balocistan Map" align="right">The history of Balochistan refers to the history of the Balochistan 
    region of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Vague allusions to the region 
    were found in Greek historical records of around 650 BCE. Prehistoric
     Balochistan dates to the Paleolithic.

Throughout history, Balochistan has served as a vibrant center 
of civilization, interacting since ancient times with centers of
 civilization in the ancient world.

There is evidence of ancient human settlements in Balochistan 
dating back to around 7000 BCE
The earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now Balochistan
 is dated to the Paleolithic era, represented by hunting camps, as well 
 as chipped and flaked stone tools. The earliest settled villages in the 
 region date to the ceramic Neolithic (c. 7000–5500 BCE),[1] and included 
 the Neolithic site of Mehrgarh located in the Kachi Plain. These villages 
 expanded in size during the subsequent Chalcolithic, when interaction
  increased. This involved the movement of finished goods and raw materials, 
  including chank shell, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and ceramics. By the Bronze Age 
  in 2500 BCE, Balochistan had become part of the Harappan cultural orbit, providing
   key resources to the expansive settlements of the Indus river basin to the east.
