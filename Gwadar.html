Gwadar (Urdu: گوادر, Urdu pronunciation: [ɡəʋɑːd̪əɾ]) is a port city
 on the southwestern coast of the Pakistani province of Balochistan.
  It is on the shores of the Arabian Sea, opposite Oman, and had a 
  population of over 90,000 in 2017 census. It was an overseas
   possession of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman from 1783 to 1958,
    when it was purchased by Pakistan.[2] It is about 120 km (75 mi) 
    southwest of Turbat. The sister port city of Chabahar in Iran's 
    Sistan and Baluchestan province is about 170 km (110 mi) to the 
    west. On 2 April 2021, Gwadar was declared the winter capital of
     Balochistan.[3]

Founded in the late 17th century as a fishing settlement, Gwadar
 became a regional trade hub within the Omani Empire in the 20th 
 century before being ceded to Pakistan (1958). Modest investment 
 from China helped accelerate Gwadar's development from 2013 to 2020 
 when the city started to develop its economy. In 2025, overall investment reached 1 billion USD.

The main industrial concern is a fish-processing factory.

Gwadar came in the focus of attention after the Kargil War when Pakistan
 felt the need of having a military naval port and the Karachi-Gwadar Road 
 (Coastal Highway) was built for defence purposes.[4] For most of its history,
  Gwadar was a small to medium-sized settlement with an economy largely based on
   artisanal fishing. The strategic value of its location was first recognized in 
   1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep-water port by the United
    States Geological Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still 
    under Omani rule.[5] Until 2001, the area's potential to be a major deep-water port
     remained untapped under successive Pakistani governments, when construction on the 
     first phase of Gwadar Port was initiated in 2007.[6] The first phase cost $248 million.
     [7] The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons,
      including lack of investment, security concerns, and the Government of Pakistan's failure to
       transfer land as promised to the port operator,
